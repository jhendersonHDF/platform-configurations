Perlmutter
==========

Perlmutter as of July 2022 has sets of compute nodes equipped with two
different types of networks; some use Slingshot 10 (ss10) while others use
Slingshot 11 (ss11). Eventually they will all be upgraded to the latter.

Please see up-to-date NERSC user documentation for the latest status of
which nodes are equipped with ss10 or ss11 network hardware.  Instructions
for compiling Mochi for use with each are available in the ss10 or ss11
subdirectories.
